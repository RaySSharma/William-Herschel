William-Herschel
================
Final version of the William Herschel project under Dr Woodruff T Sullivan III at the University of Washington, Seattle June 2013 - February 2014.
We digitize and 3D map the records of astronomer William Herschel as a means of analyzing the environment and method with which the observations were taken. We compile all mappings and print them using a 3D Printer for visualization. Presented at the January 2014 American Astronomical Society Meeting 223 in Washington, DC.
