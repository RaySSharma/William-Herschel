After entering data, visual ray lengths, modern coordinates (precession to modern epoch 2000)

Double-check all data
Precess all data
Histogram of visual rays + their statistics
Add axis labels
Think about how to solidify it
Full sky representation of data in galactic + equatorial
Histogram of fields, # of stars, visual rays

Herschel Data Set:
Add galactic coordinate shift (Precess to 1950)
Histogram of deviation from the plane of observation (DEC = 0)
Histogram of latitudes above galactic plane
Precess Sag A*
Add axes with Sun origin, going through Sag A*
Histogram of visual rays + their statistics
Add axis labels
Manually count stars
